It is a game containing one ball and two paddles,ball continuously moves till it hits paddles and goes back after hitting them.
In this simple yet challenging sports game, you need to hit the ball to your opponent's side of the table and whoever wins most times wins the game.

In this snapshot of UNITY,on the left bottom the assets file is there and in there I have created all the other files which contains all the useful information of the game like written code ,game session ,movements of ball and paddle.
On the top left corner main camera is there which shows the background of the game and the features we require for that. In the game area we can see our game and play that.
On the right side of the screen the properties shows up as we select anything from left upper corner, like for example take ball, if we select ball then it will show all the properties and we can change that according to us and from there only we create sprite which further makes a file of .cs extension (like ball.cs).
All the other paddle.cs, goal.cs, etc are created in same way.

In this snapshot, the game is shown. Both the paddles move up and down and the ball goes from one direction to the other direction and bounces back after colloiding with the paddles and if that does not happen then the opposite team scores and the other one loses.
And after one team scores then the ball comes in the centre and again the game starts.
The team with maximum scores wins.
